# Smart Traffic Signal management
 
ABSTRACT
The project work is designed to develop a dynamic density based traffic signal system. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. Traffic congestion is a severe problem in many major cities across the world and it has become a nightmare for the commuters in these cities. Conventional traffic light system is based on fixed time concept allotted to each side of the junction, which cannot be varied as per varying traffic density. Junction timings allotted are fixed. Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of the junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time. The image captured in the traffic signal is processed and converted into grayscale image then its threshold is generated, using which the area occupied by the vehicles present in the image is calculated. After calculating the area occupied by the vehicles, we will come to know in which lane the density is high, based on which the duration for green signals would be allotted for a particular lane.
